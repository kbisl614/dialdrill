# Audit Notes

## Keep

- **Gamification system** — Belts, badges, and streaks create tangible progression. This is a differentiator.
- **AI coaching after each call** — Immediate feedback loop is compelling and justifies the price.
- **Low trial price** — $5 for 5 calls with coaching is a strong risk-reversal offer.
- **Company logos bar** — Social proof element above fold. Do not modify.

## Cut

- Any mention of "revolutionary" or "game-changing" language
- Vague claims about improvement without specifics
- Feature lists without outcome framing
- Dense paragraphs — break into bullets

## Clarify

- **What happens during a call?** — Make the experience tangible. User calls AI, AI responds as a prospect, user handles objections in real-time.
- **What does coaching include?** — Specific feedback on tone, pacing, objection handling, closing.
- **What are "custom personalities"?** — Coming soon feature. Frame as future value without overpromising.
- **Trial structure** — $5 gets you 5 calls. Can purchase trial twice. Then monthly subscription.

## Missing Proof

Since we haven't launched yet, we cannot use:
- User testimonials
- Conversion rate improvements
- Before/after metrics

**Alternative approach:** Use anonymized Reddit quotes about cold call anxiety and first-call struggles. These validate the problem without fabricating results.

Example sources to pull from:
- r/sales threads about call reluctance
- r/Entrepreneur posts about founder-led sales struggles
- General sentiment: "I know I need to make calls but I freeze up"

This positions DialDrill as the solution to a widely-acknowledged problem.
