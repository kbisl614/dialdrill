# Quality Checks

## 5-Second Takeaway

**Variant A:**
"This is a practice tool for cold calling. AI prospects, real feedback, $5 to start."

**Variant B:**
"I can practice sales calls privately with AI and get better without embarrassing myself."

## 30-Second Scan Summary

A visitor scanning for 30 seconds should absorb:

1. **What it is** — AI-powered cold call practice
2. **How it works** — Pick scenario, make call, get coaching
3. **Why it matters** — Build confidence, stop burning real leads
4. **What it costs** — $5 trial, $11.99/month
5. **Next step** — Clear CTA button

Both variants deliver these five points above the fold and in the first scroll.

## Remaining Ambiguity

- **"Custom personalities" timing** — Copy says "coming soon" but no specific date. Acceptable for now.
- **Team/enterprise pricing** — Not addressed. May need a "Contact us" option if teams inquire.
- **Specific scenario list** — Copy references scenarios but doesn't list all of them. Could add a tooltip or expandable section.
- **Mobile app vs. web app** — Copy says "works on any device with a browser" but doesn't clarify if native app exists.

## Strongest Curiosity Line

**Variant A:**
> "Practice makes permanent. Start building the habits that close deals."

This reframes a familiar phrase and ties practice directly to revenue outcomes.

**Variant B:**
> "Stop dreading the dial."

Four words. Names the exact emotion. Creates immediate recognition.
