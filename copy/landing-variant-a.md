## The Problem

**Headline:**
Cold calling is a skill. Most reps learn it the hard way.

You dial. You fumble. You hang up wondering what went wrong.

Real prospects aren't forgiving. Every botched call is a lost opportunity — and a hit to your confidence.

**What reps actually say:**

> "I've been in sales for 3 months and I still get nervous before every single dial."

> "I know what I'm supposed to say. But when someone actually picks up, my mind goes blank."

> "My manager says I need more reps. But practicing on real prospects feels like burning leads."

---

## How It Works

**Headline:**
Three steps to sharper calls.

**Step 1: Pick your scenario**
Choose from common cold call situations — gatekeepers, skeptical buyers, budget objections, or "send me an email" brushoffs.

**Step 2: Make the call**
Dial into an AI prospect that responds in real-time. Handle objections. Push for the meeting. The conversation flows naturally.

**Step 3: Get your coaching**
After each call, see exactly where you nailed it and where you lost them. Actionable feedback on pacing, tone, and technique.

## Benefits

**Headline:**
Everything you need to get better.

- **Build confidence before high-stakes calls.** Run the conversation five times before you dial the real decision-maker.

- **Get feedback you can actually use.** Not vague "be more confident" advice. Specific notes on what to say differently.

- **Track your improvement over time.** Scores, streaks, and badges show your progress. Watch yourself level up.

- **Practice on your schedule.** No need to coordinate with a manager or training partner. Drill anytime.

- **Make your mistakes here, not on real prospects.** Practice on AI so you're ready when it counts.

## Proof

**Headline:**
You're not alone.

A lot of people struggle with cold calls. Here's what they say online:

> "My first month of cold calling was brutal. I wish I could've practiced somewhere safe first."

> "Role-playing with my manager feels awkward. I can't get real reps in."

> "I'd pay good money for a way to practice without embarrassing myself."

DialDrill exists because we heard you.

## Objections

**Headline:**
Questions we get asked.

**"Will talking to an AI actually help with real calls?"**
Yes. The AI responds unpredictably, just like real prospects. You'll face the same objections, the same brushoffs, the same pressure. The skills transfer.

**"I don't have time for this."**
One call takes 2-3 minutes. Five calls take less time than your morning coffee. This fits into the gaps in your day.

**"My company already has sales training."**
Training teaches concepts. DialDrill builds muscle memory. They work together.

**"What if I'm already experienced?"**
Even athletes practice fundamentals. DialDrill helps you stay sharp and test new approaches without risk.

**"Is $5 really worth it for a trial?"**
You get 5 full calls with AI coaching. That's $1 per practice session with personalized feedback. Compare that to one blown deal.
