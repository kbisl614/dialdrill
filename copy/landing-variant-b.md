## The Problem

**Headline:**
Selling your own thing is different.

You built something worth buying. But picking up the phone still feels like a fight.

No sales team to lean on. No manager to coach you. Just you, a list, and the pressure to make it work.

**Sound familiar?**

> "I know my product inside out. But the second someone answers, I forget how to talk like a normal person."

> "I've watched every sales video on YouTube. None of it helps when I'm actually on the call."

> "I hate that I avoid the phone. I know it's costing me money."

## How It Works

**Headline:**
Practice on your terms.

**Step 1: Choose your challenge**
Pick a scenario that matches your real calls — cold outreach, following up, handling pushback, or asking for the sale.

**Step 2: Have the conversation**
Call an AI prospect that talks back. It won't go easy on you. Expect objections, hesitation, and real resistance.

**Step 3: See what to fix**
After each call, get specific feedback. Not generic tips — actual notes on your pacing, tone, and responses.

## Benefits

**Headline:**
Everything you need to level up.

- **Practice without embarrassment.** No one's watching. No judgment. Just you getting better.

- **Learn by doing, not watching.** Videos and books don't build reflexes. Real practice does.

- **Train on your own time.** You don't need a coach, a team, or anyone's permission. Practice whenever you want.

- **Build real confidence.** Not fake-it-til-you-make-it confidence. The kind that comes from knowing you've done this before.

- **Make mistakes here, not on real prospects.** Test your pitch on AI first.

## Proof

**Headline:**
This struggle is common.

A lot of people talk about call anxiety. You're not the only one:

> "Sales is the one part of running my business I genuinely dread."

> "I've lost deals because I couldn't get the words out right. It's embarrassing."

> "I need practice but I don't have anyone to practice with."

DialDrill gives you that practice space.

## Objections

**Headline:**
Fair questions, honest answers.

**"Can AI really simulate a real sales call?"**
Better than you'd expect. The AI pushes back, asks tough questions, and doesn't let you off easy. The pressure feels real.

**"I don't have a sales background. Will this work for me?"**
That's exactly who this is for. You'll learn faster by doing than by studying theory.

**"I barely have time to make real calls."**
One practice call takes 2-3 minutes. You can fit three sessions into a lunch break.

**"What if I'm already decent at sales?"**
Decent isn't the same as sharp. DialDrill helps you refine your delivery and test new angles without consequences.

**"Why pay $5 when I could just practice in my head?"**
Mental rehearsal isn't the same as verbal rehearsal. Saying words out loud — and hearing something unexpected back — is where the real training happens.

## FAQ

**How realistic are the AI conversations?**
Realistic enough to make you sweat. The AI responds dynamically based on what you say, not from a script.

**Do I need any special equipment?**
Just a device with a browser and a microphone. Phone, tablet, or laptop all work.

**What kind of feedback do I get?**
Specific notes on your pacing, tone, objection handling, and overall delivery. Not vague encouragement — actionable takeaways.

**Is my data kept private?**
Yes. Your calls are only used to generate your personal feedback. Nothing is shared.

**Can I practice specific situations I'm struggling with?**
Yes. Pick scenarios that match your real-world challenges. We're adding new ones regularly.
